AKreedz posted source and said anyone can use the source code. I updated for 1.1! 

Similar to transporterpod, but Cargo Pod Transport has more capacity and can fly anywhere on the world map without disappearing when it landed.

Tips:If you can not find your cargo pod, check your pawn inventory!

### Warning:
#### Do not drop to the edge of map,this pod will be removed if it doesn't get enough space to landed

You can building Cargo Pod Transport after you unlock the transportpod tech(In Misc category if not using a research helper (ResearchPal etc).
